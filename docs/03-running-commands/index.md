You can use Bolt to run arbitrary commands on a set of remote hosts. Let's see that in practice before we move on to more advanced features. Choose the exercise based on the operating system of your test nodes.

- [Running PowerShell commands on Windows nodes](#running-powershell-commands-on-windows-nodes)

# Prerequisites
Complete the following before you start this lesson:

1. [Installing Bolt](../01-installing-bolt)
1. [Setting up test nodes](../02-acquiring-nodes)

# Running shell commands on Linux nodes

Bolt by default uses SSH for transport. If you can connect to systems remotely, you can use Bolt to run shell commands. It reuses your existing SSH configuration for authentication, which is typically provided in `~/.ssh/config`.

To run a command against a remote Linux node, use the following command syntax:
```shell
bolt command run <command> --nodes <nodes>
```

To run a command against a remote node using a username and password rather than keys use the following syntax:
```shell
bolt command run <command> --nodes <nodes> --user <user> --password <password>
```

Run the `uptime` command to view how long the system has been running. If you are using existing nodes on your system, replace `node1` with the address for your node.

```shell
bolt command run uptime --nodes node1
```

The result:
```
Started on node1...
Finished on node1:
  STDOUT:
     22:42:18 up 16 min,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.03
Successful on 1 node: node1
Ran on 1 node in 0.42 seconds

```

**Tip:** If you receive the error `Host key verification failed` make sure the correct host keys are in your `known_hosts` file or pass `--no-host-key-check` to future Bolt commands. Bolt will not honor `StrictHostKeyChecking` in your SSH configuration.

Run the 'uptime' command on multiple nodes by passing a comma-separated list. If you are using existing nodes on your system, replace `node1,node2,node3` with addresses for your nodes. If you get an error about `Host key verification` run the rest of the examples with the `--no-host-key-check` flag to disable host key verification.

```shell
bolt command run uptime --nodes node1,node2,node3
```

The result:
```
Started on node1...
Started on node3...
Started on node2...
Finished on node2:
  STDOUT:
     21:03:37 up  2:06,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.03
Finished on node3:
  STDOUT:
     21:03:37 up  2:05,  0 users,  load average: 0.08, 0.03, 0.05
Finished on node1:
  STDOUT:
     21:03:37 up  2:07,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
Successful on 3 nodes: node1,node2,node3
Ran on 3 nodes in 0.52 seconds
```

3. Create an inventory file to store information about your nodes and refer to them as a group.  Later exercises will refer to the default group `all`. For more information on how to set up other named groups, see the [Inventory File docs](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/inventory_file.html).

For example, if you are using the provided Vagrant configuration file, save the following to `~/.puppetlabs/bolt/inventory.yaml`:

```yaml
---
nodes: [node1, node2, node3]
config:
  ssh:
    host-key-check: false
```

# Running PowerShell commands on Windows nodes

Bolt can communicate over WinRM and execute PowerShell commands when running Windows nodes. To run a command against a remote Windows node, use the following command syntax:

```shell
bolt command run <command> --nodes winrm://<node> --user <user> --password <password>
```

Note the `winrm://` prefix for the node address. Also note the `--username` and `--password` flags for passing authentication information. In addition, unless you have set up SSL for WinRM communication, you must supply the `--no-ssl` flag. Otherwise running a Bolt command will result in an `unknown protocol` error.

```shell
bolt command run <command> --no-ssl --nodes winrm://<node>,winrm://<node> --user <user> --password <password>
```

Set a variable with the list of nodes.  Later exercises will refer to this variable. You can incorporate the username and password into the node address. For example, if you are using the provided Vagrant configuration file, set the following:

```shell
WINNODE=winrm://vagrant:vagrant@localhost:55985
```

On Windows, you can do the same thing with Powershell:

```powershell
$WINNODE="winrm://vagrant:vagrant@localhost:55985"
```

Run the following command to list all of the processes running on a remote machine.

```shell
bolt command run "gps | select ProcessName" --nodes $WINNODE --no-ssl
```

Use following syntax to list all of the processes running on multiple remote machines.

```shell
bolt command run <command> --nodes winrm://<node>,winrm://<node> --user <user> --password <password>
```
