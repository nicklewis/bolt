title: Installing Bolt
difficulty: Basic
time: Approximately 10 minutes
---

In this exercise you will install Bolt so you can get started with Puppet Tasks.

# Installation Details

Bolt is packaged for the major operating systems. Please refer to the [installation documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/bolt_installing.html) to install Bolt for the OS you are using. 

**Note** For this lab and for most use cases it is recommended that bolt is NOT installed as a Ruby Gem. This is because optional (but highly useful) supporting modules are only included in packages and must be installed manually when using the Gem.    

# Next steps

Now that you have Bolt installed you can move on to:
